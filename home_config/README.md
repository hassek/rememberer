# List of configuration files to setup my own environment

Besides copying all the files here present in my home directory, there are other files that I should copy but can't share here because security reasons
The list of files is as follows:

```
.zhistory
.aws/config
```

Also, add the `git scripts` into /usr/local/bin/

# Configure fzf

Run `$(brew --prefix)/opt/fzf/install`

# Configure iTerm2 keys

Go to `Settings -> Profiles -> Keys` and pick `Esc+` for both Left and Right option keys

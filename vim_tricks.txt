A common requirement, particularly when programming, is to copy or delete text from one location, and use what was copied or deleted to replace text in one or more other locations. This tip describes how this operation is performed using standard Vim techniques, and with some tricks that may make it easier.

How to copy/pasteEdit
For simplicity, this shows how to copy a word and paste it over other words. However, the visual selection could be varied to use any text.

yiw	Yank inner word (copy word under cursor, say "first").
...	Move the cursor to another word (say "second").
viwp	Select "second", then replace it with "first".
...	Move the cursor to another word (say "third").
viw"0p	Select "third", then replace it with "first".
Copy a word and paste it over other words:

yiw	Yank inner word (copy word under cursor, say "first").
...	Move the cursor to another word (say "second").
ciw Ctrl-R 0 Esc	Change "second", replacing it with "first".
...	Move the cursor to another word (say "third").
.	Repeat the operation (change word and replace it with "first").
...	Move the cursor to another word and press . to repeat the change.
Copy text in quotes, and paste it over other quoted text:

yi"	Yank inner text (text containing cursor which is in quotes).
...	Move the cursor to other quoted text.
ci" Ctrl-R 0 Esc	Change the quoted text, replacing it with the copied text.
...	Move the cursor to more quoted text.
.	Repeat the operation (change the quoted text and replace it with the copy).
...	Move the cursor to more quoted text and press . to repeat the change.
Copy a line and paste it over other lines:

yy	Yank current line (say "first line").
...	Move the cursor to another line (say "second line").
Vp	Select "second line", then replace it with "first line".
...	Move the cursor to another line (say "third line").
V"0p	Select "third line", then replace it with "first line".
